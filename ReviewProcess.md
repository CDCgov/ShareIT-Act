# CDC Share IT Act Metadata Preview & Review Process

This repository supports the CDC implementation of the SHARE IT Act by publishing a preview of the upcoming `code.json` metadata inventory for custom-developed software. This allows CDC teams to review and validate entries before each official public release.

---

## üìã Purpose

To help CDC developers, project teams, ADIs, and C/I/Os:
- Review repository metadata generated by the AI-based scanner
- Confirm accuracy of key fields (e.g., `Org`, `Contact Email`, `Exemption`, etc.)
- Make corrections as needed by editing `README.md` files in their repositories
- Ensure compliance with the SHARE IT Act

---

## üîç How to Review Metadata

1. Open the latest **[metadata_preview_table.html](metadata_preview_table.html)** file published in this repository.
2. Search by:
   - Repository name
   - Org or CDC program
   - Contact email
   - Exemption status
3. Review key fields, including:
   - `Repository Name`
   - `Organization`
   - `Contact Email`
   - `Exemption`
   - `Repository URL`
   - `Version`
   - `Status`

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Submit Changes

There are two ways to update incorrect or missing metadata:

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Edit Your `README.md` with Metadata Markers

To make your corrections **persistent across future scans**, update your repository‚Äôs `README.md` using structured override markers. These markers will override the AI scanner‚Äôs inferences.

Example:

```md
Org: NCCDPHP  
Contact Email: chronicdev@cdc.gov  
Exemption: exemptByAgencySystem  
Exemption Justification: This code is used only within CDC infrastructure and is not reusable externally.  
```

üëâ See the full list of markers and usage examples in the [CDC Metadata Implementation Guide](https://docs.cdc.gov/docs/ea/codeshare/implementation-guide#readmemd-override-optional-markers).

### üìù 2. Submit a Pull Request (PR) to this Repository

If your repository is archived or you cannot directly edit it:
- Fork this repository
- Edit the `metadata_preview_table.html` or submit corrections via the Issues tab
- Include your repository name and proposed correction(s) in the PR description
- Label the PR as `metadata-fix`

## üïí Review Deadlines & Schedule

Publishing occurs quarterly, and each preview window opens **30 days prior** to the publishing date. See the [Review Schedule](Updated_Review_Schedule_2025_2026.md) for all deadlines.

Exemptions auto-assigned by the AI scanner are also listed in `exempted_log.csv`. You will only be contacted directly if your repository is flagged with a potentially incorrect exemption that lacks justification.
