# CDC Share IT Act Metadata Preview & Review Process

This repository supports the CDC implementation of the SHARE IT Act by publishing a preview of the upcoming `code.json` metadata inventory for custom-developed software. This allows CDC teams to review and validate entries before each official public release.

## üìã Purpose

To help CDC developers, project teams, ADIs, and C/I/Os:
- Review repository metadata generated by the AI-based scanner
- Confirm accuracy of key fields (e.g., `Org`, `Contact Email`, `Exemption`, etc.)
- Make corrections as needed by editing `README.md` files in their repositories
- Ensure compliance with the SHARE IT Act
