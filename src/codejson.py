    We follow these steps in order on determining usageType:
    1. We look for the words "exemption" and "exemption justification" markers in the README.md file.
       If they exist, usageType is set to the exemption, and the text for the justification ends up with exemptionText.
    2. We checks the repository's programming languages. If the repo contains only non-code content (like Markdown, text, HTML/CSS, shell scripts, etc.), usageType is set to exemptNonCode.
    3. AI Exploratory Check: If we can use AI to infer on the repository, we'll prompt the AI to verify whether the repository's primary purpose is experimental, a demo, a tutorial, or a proof-of-concept. If so, it's exempted (usually as exemptByCIO) with a justification explaining why.
    4. AI General Exemption Check: If we can use AI to infer on the repository, we'lll prompt the AI to verify for other specific exemptions based on the repository's name, description, and README content.
    5. Default: If none of the above conditions are met, the usageType defaults to governmentWideReuse.

    README Marker: It then looks for an Organization: or Org: : marker in the README.md file. If found, this value will override any previous inference.
    AI Inference (Fallback): If the organization is still a generic one (e.g., just "CDC") and AI is enabled, the AI analyzes the repository's content to suggest a more specific organization from a known list.
